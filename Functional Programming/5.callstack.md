## Call Stack

Every time you call a function, JS pushes a Stack Frame onto the Call Stack. This frame isn't just a placeholder; it's a chunk of memory that contains:
- The function's Arguments.
- Local variables.
- The Return Address (where to go back to when the function finishes).


**Stack Overflow**
When you have infinite recursion, you are physically filling up the memory allocated for the stack by the browser/engine (usually ~1MB). Once that memory is full, the engine throws a "Stack Overflow" because it cannot allocate any more memory for a new frame.
**Note:** This is why "Recursion" is often replaced with "Iteration" (loops) in performance-critical frontend code (like Canvas rendering in your project) to avoid stack limits.
